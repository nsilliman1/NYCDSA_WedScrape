NYCDSA_WebScrap Project

This is the second project in my NYCDSA program. This project demonstrates the use of Scrapy and additional analysis.

The rational for this project is to examine activity on Alteryx Community forum page and look at that in relation to the stock price.

This data was scraped from Alterxy's Community website. On this site the encourage discussion of the platform and is a place where users can ask questions and also suggest improvements.

The Shiny App can be found here:

I would have loved to expand on this project more, as there is so much to do with this data! However I hope this demonstrates a good start in the aspects of Scrapy and its application.
